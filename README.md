# Customer Activity Prediction for "One Click" Online Store

## Project Title: ClickGuard - Customer Retention Intelligence

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to predict the likelihood of customer churn for the "One Click" online store over the next three months. By analyzing customer behavior, marketing interactions, product preferences, and financial metrics, the project aims to identify key factors influencing customer loyalty and provide actionable insights for personalized retention strategies.

## Objectives
- Build a classification model to predict the probability of reduced customer purchasing activity in the next three months.
- Analyze the impact of communication strategies and service quality on customer retention.
- Investigate the relationship between product preferences and long-term customer loyalty.
- Examine the influence of website behavior and technical issues on purchasing activity.
- Segment the customer base based on profitability and churn risk.
- Develop personalized marketing offers tailored to each customer segment's behavioral patterns and preferences.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**  
   - Load and study datasets containing customer behavior, revenue, website interaction time, and profitability metrics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Merge datasets into a unified analytical base and handle missing or inconsistent data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Identify key behavioral patterns and correlations influencing customer activity.
4. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Prepare features for predictive modeling based on communication strategies, product preferences, website behavior, and financial metrics.
5. **Model Development**  
   - Train and validate classification models to predict customer churn probability.
6. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Segment customers by profitability and churn risk for targeted retention strategies.
7. **Personalized Recommendations**  
   - Develop tailored marketing strategies to enhance customer retention and experience.
